# Jest with HTTP Utilities (Jessica)

The repository modifies the internal Jest API and runs the test programmatically, note that there is **no official support** to run test with jest programmatically (read [facebook/jest #5048](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/5048)), so this project usage may be broke in the future.

This repository was made for my own research, I'm just curious with jest internal and playing with it (to find interesting points why my bros using Jest instead of Mocha, I want to find out that's beyond their opinion). There's no more reason.

> TLDR: My writing about this is coming soon
